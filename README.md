# e-plantShopping

## Paradise Nursery Shopping Application

This project is a React-based plant shopping application where users can browse houseplants, add them to a shopping cart, and view updated totals. The application includes a landing page, product listing page, and shopping cart page. The project uses React and Redux Toolkit for state management, and reacts dynamically to user interactions such as adding plants and updating cart quantities.

The application is part of the IBM Developer Skills Network React course final project.
